# BKMD - Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse Dongler/Device

## SOFTWARE Desktop App
As the first development phase in 2025 occurred in Swift to make an demo prototype proving functionality and possibility of this project.

We decided to shift from native development to more versatile options, cross-platform development in Electron or similar framework as we expect user to be available to power during usage BKMD as the main use will be:  DESKTOP PC + BKMD <-> BKMD-config-app + Laptop  

Sacrificing optimization for flexibility, cost and uniformity of development.

We expect major updates and upgrades, to early final product to be made in 2026. 

## HARDWARE


## WORK IN PROGRESS

Our goal is to create universal USB dongle that would allow you to control different PC over WPAN.
We use ESP32S3 as it offers HID and BLE peripherals. 


## Notes
